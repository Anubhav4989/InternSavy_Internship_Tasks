# Internsavy-Data Science Internship  

Hello everyone! I'm Anubhav Kumar Tiwary, and I'm excited to share my journey through the InternSavy Data Science Internship. In this repository, I'll briefly describe the two tasks I worked on during my internship. 

## **Task 1: Use classification technique for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective**

In this task, the goal is to use classification techniques to predict the likelihood of graduate admissions from an Indian perspective. By analyzing data related to students' academic and test scores, we aim to build a model that can determine whether a student is likely to be accepted into a graduate program. This prediction will provide valuable insights into the admissions process and help identify factors that influence acceptance decisions.

## **Task 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis with Python**

This task focuses on customer segmentation analysis using Python. I'll be working with customer data, and my goal is to categorize them into different groups based on their characteristics and behaviors. This segmentation will provide valuable insights for businesses, helping them better understand their customers and tailor their services accordingly.
